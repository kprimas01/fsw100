            <p>I aspire to be a web developer and work in a office or just work from home one day.
                I have learned a lot. I work a full time job  as a summer camp teacher for parents who are essional workers during covid and it may be 12 13 hour days and that takes a lot out of me becouse i have kids and a home too. when i started this class i was about to stop the second week i felt like everthing was moving so fast and i didnt know what to do. 
                I learned to better use my time and make more time for homework <b>and do not fall behind on homework</b> and even after working all day and feeling like i cant go anymore. Sometimes after getting feed back that somthing is not right i use to become very discouraged and i sometimes would want to give up but i know im doing this for a better life for my children.
                And to tell them they can be anything that they want to be and not to give up.
                My biggest accomplishment was being able to do this and i hope i pass this class i was able to find that when i was working on somthing in school it became fun for me and less stressed as the weeks move on i just know that it somtimes takes me a while to get learn everthing so my next class i will definitely work a head. I dont have a big support system but i enjoyed being in class and learning somthing new all the time
